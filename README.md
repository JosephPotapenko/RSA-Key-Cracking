# RSA-Key-Cracking

## Overview

This repository contains Lab 3 code exploring RSA key generation, encryption/decryption, simple cracking by factoring the modulus, and timing experiments at small prime bit sizes. Core Python files:

- `lab3-part1.py` – Generates an RSA key pair and demonstrates encrypt/decrypt in both directions.
- `lab3-part2.py` – Factors a provided modulus with `sympy.primefactors` to recover the private key and decrypt a ciphertext.
- `lab3-part3.py` – Times prime generation + factoring across several bit sizes and plots results.
- `prime.py` – Miller–Rabin primality test and prime generation helper.

## AI-Generated HTML UI

Two supplemental HTML pages (`index.html`, `all-in-one.html`) were auto-generated by an AI assistant to provide:

- An interactive in-browser RSA demo (small, insecure toy keys) mirroring the lab logic.
- Embedded source code, images, and the lab PDF for easy navigation.
- A light/dark theme toggle (default dark) persisted with `localStorage`.
- Visual badges marking the UI as AI-generated – the underlying Python lab code was not modified for functionality.

These pages are for demonstration and documentation only; they intentionally omit real-world RSA safeguards (padding/OAEP, large key sizes, constant-time operations, side-channel protections). Do not use the in-browser demo for any production or security purposes.

## Running the Lab Code

Install dependencies:

```
pip install sympy matplotlib
```

Example usage:

```
python lab3-part1.py 64
python lab3-part2.py
python lab3-part3.py
```

Increase the bit length for more realistic (but slower) key generation; factoring becomes rapidly infeasible beyond very small sizes with the naive approach used here.

## Security Caveats

- No padding (e.g., OAEP) is applied; raw RSA is malleable and not semantically secure.
- Factoring uses `sympy.primefactors`, not advanced algorithms (Quadratic/Number Field Sieve).
- Chosen exponents are standard (`e=65537`) but key sizes are intentionally tiny for demonstration.
- Timing plots reflect toy scales only.
